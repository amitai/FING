# FING
 Funny Internal Network Generator

Are you a busy sysadmin that needs to create subnets all the time?
Are you tired of trying to find that perfect subnet for your VLAN?
Use FING to find the best subnet for you!

FING will generate a list of /24 blocks for all RFC1918-compliant private addresses.
It will then prompt the user for an integer, and compile all matching results in an
output file.  It will show five random results and then allow the user to view the
rest with its favorite text viewer.
